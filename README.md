# Structural classification of proteins based on thecomputationally efficient recurrence quantificationanalysis and horizontal visibility graphs

Run the main.m file included in the source_code folder to reproduce the total results of the paper. Additionally, a randomly shuffled trained model is provided in the folder trained_models for each study case represented on Table 3 of the paper for SVM and FDA classifiers accorndingly. In order to evaluate the trained models on the test set load one of the provided models and run the file evaluate_model.m.
